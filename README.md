# Insp Test

Some coding test stuff

Note that we won't typically try to solve all exercises here. We would just cherrypick one or two, depending on the flow of the technical interview.

## Run tests

There are currently three tests. You can run each by executing these:
```
$ npm run test:clone-object
$ npm run test:most-recurring
$ npm run test:full-justify
```

There's no tooling here to test out the space and/or time complexity of the solutions though :P
