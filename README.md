# Insp Test

Some coding test stuff

## Run tests

There are currently three tests. You can run each by executing these:
```
$ npm run test:clone-object
$ npm run test:most-recurring
$ npm run test:full-justify
```

There's no tooling here to test out the space and/or time complexity of the solutions though :P
